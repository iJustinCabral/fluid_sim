# Simulating Fluids

Another stepping stone on my joy of programming adventure is to create a fluid simulator. This type of thing covers so many different areas that it's a perfect way to continue rounding out my skills. This was inspired by watching jdh on YouTube where he talked about the updates to his FPS, which included a fluid sim for blood inside the players onscreen arm which I thought was really cool. 

Seeing that Odin is used in software such as LiquiGen, I thought why not flex with my own? 

I can't stress enough how much fun I've been having just putting thoughts to pixels using Odin. Where as before when using things like Swift, SwiftUI for app dev, and the JavaScript rats nest for WebDev, I just felt defeated by the consant nonsensical updates, package managment, and brokeness. I can't understate just how simple, clean, and joyful its been writing code again.
